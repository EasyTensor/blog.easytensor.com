Hi Everyone!

We're excited to launch this newsletter to keep you updated with the latest and greatest tools we've been building at EasyTensor.

Since this is the first newsletter we send out, let's recap: **EasyTensor** _is the easiest way to use and share your Machine Learning models on the cloud_.

This newsletter packs a bunch of updates, so strap in!

# [PyTorch Support]({{< ref "pytorch-support.md" >}})

This has been a long time coming, but we're finally releasing support to the second most popular machine learning framework: PyTorch. With it comes a new selector for frameworks on the upload page.

# The Explore Page

EasyTensor now has a whole new tab: `Explore`. It is the perfect place for new users to see what others have built and what public models they can use and upload.

# Redesigned Model Cards

We've been adding more information and features to the model object, and the model cards were starting to get quite big, so we decided to redesign them!

Instead of plain text, we opted for a more visual experience. All the information is still accessible with a mouse hover, but we've opened up more white space to allow for a less congested feel. With the new design, you can do much more with a model at a glance than ever before.

The card is highly interactive and you can edit your model's details right from the main page.

# [This Blog](https://blog.easytensor.com)

Last but not least, this blog was one of the milestones for this week! We realized that while we do have an MVP product on our hand, there wasn't a lot of supporting documentation around it. This blog is the first step towards creating a knowledge base around EasyTensor and why it's the best place to do ML out there!

# Coming soon

There is a lot more to come from EasyTensor in the coming weeks. Here are a few of our upcoming projects that you can expect an update on in the next newsletter:

- Hugging Face model support
- Deployment Logs
- Model Pages
